## Instructions: Tag/Keyword Extraction

**Task**: Extract 3-5 highly relevant keywords (tags) from the article summary.

These tags should capture:
- **Key problems/topics**: What central issues or areas does the article address? (e.g., data privacy, quantum computing, computer graphics, physical simulation)
- **Core innovations**: What novel approaches or ideas are presented? (e.g., federated learning, zero-knowledge proofs, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks)
- **Notable methods**: What significant techniques or methodologies are employed? (e.g., convolutional neural networks, Bayesian optimization, alternating direction method of multipliers, reduced order modeling)
- **Tools/frameworks**: What specific technologies or platforms are utilized? (e.g., TensorFlow, CUDA/GPU, SuiteSparse)

**Output**: Format your response as a comma-separated list of specific, concise tags.
