#### Doing a Literature Survey

Paper reading skills are put to the test in doing a literature survey.  This will require you to read tens of papers, perhaps in an unfamiliar field.  What papers should you read?  Here is how you can use the three-pass approach to help.

First, use an academic search engine such as Google Scholar or CiteSeer and some well-chosen keywords to find three to five recent highly-cited papers in the area.  Do one pass on each paper to get a sense of the work, then read their related work sections.  You will find a thumbnail summary of the recent work, and perhaps, if you are lucky, a pointer to a recent survey paper.  If you can find such a survey, you are done.  Read the survey, congratulating yourself on your good luck.

Otherwise, in the second step, find shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography.  These are the key papers and researchers in that area.  Download the key papers and set them aside.  Then go to the websites of the key researchers and see where they’ve published recently. That will help you identify the top conferences in that field because the best researchers usually publish in the top conferences.

The third step is to go to the website for these top conferences and look through their recent proceedings.  A quick scan will usually identify recent high-quality related work. These papers, along with the ones you set aside earlier, constitute the first version of your survey.  Make two passes through these papers.  If they all cite a key paper that you did not find earlier, obtain and read it, iterating as necessary.

If you are reading a paper to do a review, you should also read Timothy Roscoe’s paper on “Writing reviews for systems conferences”.  If you’re planning to write a technical paper, you should refer both to Henning Schulzrinne’s comprehensive web site and George Whitesides’s excellent overview of the process.   Finally, Simon Peyton Jones has a website that covers the entire spectrum of research skills.

Iain H. McLean of Psychology, Inc. has put together a downloadable ‘review matrix’ that simplifies paper reviewing using the three-pass approach for papers in experimental psychology, which can probably be used, with minor modifications, for papers in other areas.
