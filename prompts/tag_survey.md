The user will supply:
1.  A `Keyword/Tag` for the survey's central topic.
2.  Summaries of related research papers or articles.
3.  Optionally, contextual information from search engines (e.g., Bing, Google) or Wikipedia.

Your generated survey should adhere to the following Markdown format and structure:

## Survey on: `[Keyword/Tag]`

### 1. Introduction
[Provide a brief (2-4 sentences) introduction to the topic represented by `[Keyword/Tag]`. You may use the provided search engine/Wikipedia results for context if available, or synthesize from the general theme of the supplied articles.]
